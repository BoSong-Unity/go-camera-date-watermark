Add date watermark (from exif) to jpg images in one folder.

It just likes old-fashioned camera pictures.

## Build

```
make
```

## Usage

```
./timestamp -path=/your/jpg/images/folder/path
```

All images with watermark will locate in `/output` folder under the input path.

## Example

```
./timestamp -path=./example
```
Check the pic with date watermark in `./example/output`!
